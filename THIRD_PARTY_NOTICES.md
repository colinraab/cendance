# Third-Party Notices

cendance depends on third-party software and assets. This file is an inventory,
not a replacement for the applicable license terms.

The cendance application source is licensed under `AGPL-3.0-only`; see the
root `LICENSE` file. The licenses below apply separately to the named
third-party components and assets.

## JUCE

JUCE is included as a Git submodule. The pinned checkout describes the JUCE
modules as dual-licensed under AGPLv3 or a commercial JUCE license. See
`JUCE/LICENSE.md` in the initialized submodule for the full terms and its own
dependency notices.

cendance uses JUCE under the AGPLv3 option. A distributor may instead rely on
an appropriate commercial JUCE license if they have obtained one directly
from JUCE.

## FTXUI

FTXUI is fetched by CMake at commit
`5cfed50702f52d51c1b189b5f97f8beaf5eaa2a6` (`v6.1.9`) and is licensed
under the MIT License.
